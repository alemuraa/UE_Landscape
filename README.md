# Unreal Engine Project - README

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a scene in Unreal Engine based on the provided tutorials and lectures. The goal is to create a landscape with specific features, implement dynamic lighting, and ensure proper navigation and interaction elements.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Tutorial Content

- Incorporate elements from the **"Composition with Starter Content"** tutorials (Parts 1 & 2).
- Apply concepts from the recent **lighting lecture** to enhance the scene's visual appeal.

### 2. Landscape Creation

- **Section Size:** 31x31
- **Sections per Component:** 1x1
- **Number of Components:** 8x8
- **Overall Resolution:** 249x249
- **Materials:** Utilize three distinct materials for painting and modeling the landscape. Include features like headlands or mountains to contextualize the different materials.

### 3. Atmospheric Materials

- Replace atmospheric materials to set up two directional lights (Sun and Moon) to simulate day and night scenarios.

### 4. Blueprints and Navigation

- Implement blueprints for door operations, including opening and closing, as demonstrated in the tutorials.
- Ensure that the **ThirdPersonCharacter** can navigate the map effectively.

### 5. Navigable Area

- Define navigable areas using cubic meshes. These meshes should be marked as **"Hidden in Game"** and should not cast shadows.

### 6. Level Setup

- Organize all elements within a single **Level Actor**, which will be configured as the opening map for the project.

## Submission Instructions

1. **Save and Compress:**
   - Save your Unreal Engine project.
   - Compress the project folder into a zip file.

2. **Upload:**
   - Upload the zip file to **OneDrive** and generate a sharing link.

3. **Submit:**
   - Copy the sharing link into a text file.
   - Upload the text file with the link to the designated section on **Aulaweb**.

## Deadline

- **December 15**. This deadline provides flexibility for those who may not attend synchronously or prefer to focus on guided lectures.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure all elements are properly integrated and functional before submission.
- Refer to the provided tutorials and lectures for detailed guidance on each requirement.
