# Unreal Engine Project - README

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a scene in Unreal Engine based on the provided tutorials and lectures. The goal is to create a landscape with specific features, implement dynamic lighting, and ensure proper navigation and interaction elements.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Landscape Creation

- **Section Size:** 31x31
- **Sections per Component:** 1x1
- **Number of Components:** 8x8
- **Overall Resolution:** 249x249
- **Materials:** Utilize three distinct materials for painting and modeling the landscape. Include features like headlands or mountains to contextualize the different materials.

### 2. Atmospheric Materials

- Replace atmospheric materials to set up two directional lights (Sun and Moon) to simulate day and night scenarios.

### 3. Blueprints and Navigation

- Implement blueprints for door operations, including opening and closing, as demonstrated in the tutorials.
- Ensure that the **ThirdPersonCharacter** can navigate the map effectively.

### 4. Navigable Area

- Define navigable areas using cubic meshes. These meshes should be marked as **"Hidden in Game"** and should not cast shadows.

### 5. Level Setup

- Organize all elements within a single **Level Actor**, which will be configured as the opening map for the project.
